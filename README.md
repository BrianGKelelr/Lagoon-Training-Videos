This program is a website meant to be part of the new employee training at the Lagoon theme park. It is essentially a base for Lagoon to work off as they can modify the website however they want. The training starts on the file "lostChild.html" so select that file to get started. You must answer a series of questions correctly until you get to the final page with no questions, at which point you have completed the training. 

This website was created by Sawyer Heaton, Brian Keller, Weston Schwartz, and Boston Wilde
